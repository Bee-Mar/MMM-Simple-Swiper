** What is this, and why did we make this module?
   This module attempts to determine distance/motion based on the output
   from the sensors in a simple, efficient manner. When the
   =MMM-Simple-Swiper= modules loads, it sends a socket notification to
   =node_helper.js=. The =node_helper= then creates a child process,
   which calls a C executable, and supplies the JSON config as a command
   line argument in string format. The JSON string is parsed, the values
   are stored in structs, and an infinite loop is entered. Within the
   inifinte loop, two threads are created to collect the distance
   measurements, remove the outliers, and calculate the average
   distance. The two threads are joined, and the averages are printed to
   =stdout= in a =[FLOAT]:[FLOAT]= format, which is read by the child
   process created in =node_helper.js=. From here, the values are checked
   to see if both are within a certain threshold. If the values meet this
   criteria and there is a large enough difference between the two
   values, a socket nofication is sent to the =MMM-Simple-Swiper= module,
   which sends a notification to the =MMM-pages= module.

** Dependencies
   This module has three dependencies, all of which are listed in the
   table below. When you clone this repo, install the =wiringPi= library using the instructions from the table below, and run and =npm install= inside repo's directory.

   | Library Dependencies | Link/Installation                            |

** Installation
You can either follow the manual instructions for installation below, or you can make use of the =MMPM (Magic Mirror Package Manager)= found here: https://github.com/Bee-Mar/mmpm

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# assuming mmpm is already installed

$ sudo apt-get install wiringpi -y
$ mmpm -i MMM-Simple-Swiper
$ cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/MMM-Simple-Swiper && make

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
   # manual installation
   $ cd ~/MagicMirror/modules/
   $ https://github.com/Bee-Mar/MMM-Simple-Swiper.git
   $ cd MMM-Simple-Swiper
   $ sudo apt-get install wiringpi -y
   $ npm install
   $ make
#+END_SRC

Be sure to add the snippet for your =config.js= file below.

** SuDON'T

   When running this module, there is absolutely no need to execute
   =sudo= with =npm start=. This is due to the small hack (I guess it can
   be considered a hack??) used when launching the child process within
   =node_helper.js=. The code snippet where this occurs is shown below:


#+BEGIN_SRC js
  // other code above ...

  var child = require("child_process").spawn("sudo", [
     __dirname + "/swiper",
     JSON.stringify(payload),
  ]);

  // other code below ...
#+END_SRC

Notice the first argument of the =spawn= function being =sudo=, which
takes care of the permissions required for the GPIO pins. We show you
this in an attempt to be transparent, and asure you no funny business
is taking place.

** Config
   The default config is shown below, and the order in which the values
   are listed are not important.  Feel free to tweak the values to your
   needs. Also, please read the =Tested Conditions/Warning= section
   below.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
// other module configs ...

   module: "MMM-Simple-Swiper",
   disabled: false,
   config: {
       echoLeftPin: 24, // GPIO #
       triggerLeftPin: 23, // GPIO #
       echoRightPin: 26, // GPIO #
       triggerRightPin: 25, // GPIO #
       threshold: 175, // in centimeters
       distanceDiff: 1.25, // difference between both sensors
       debug: false, // if true, the raw data is printed to stdout while MagicMirror is running
       magicMirrorDelay: 1000, // number of milliseconds between passing data from C executable to the node_helper for MagicMirror to act upon
       sensorDelay: 10, // the number of microseconds each sensor waits to check for changes in voltage (fine tune this for CPU performance)
   }

// other module configs ...
#+END_SRC

** MMM-pages
   When using with =MMM-pages=, place =MMM-Simple-Swiper= within the
   =fixed= property. The =fixed= property contains the list of modules
   which are fixed in place (as the name would suggest).

   Just so it's more clear, here's the example config taken from the
   =MMM-pages= Github, with our module tucked nicely inside the
   =fixed= section.

#+BEGIN_SRC js
  modules: [
    {
      module: 'MMM-pages',
      config: {
        modules: [
          [ "weatherforecast", "newsfeed"],
          [ "calendar", "compliments" ]
        ],

        fixed: [
          "clock",
          "currentweather",
          "MMM-page-indicator",
          "MMM-Simple-Swiper"
        ],

      }
    }
  ]
#+END_SRC


** Tested Conditions/Warning
   This has only been tested on the RaspberryPi 3 B using Raspbian (based
   on Debian Stretch), using two HC-SR04 ultra sonic sensors. This module
   was intended to be run along side =MMM-pages= and
   =MMM-page-indicator=, and has done so very well in our testing. Also,
   since the C executable outputs raw values from the sensors, if you
   wanted to take the code and utilize it in another project, please,
   feel free. In fact, you're encouraged to do so.

   While messing around with the =delay= parameter of the config in the
   =MMM-Simple-Swiper= file, we did notice that anything less than 600
   milliseconds can cause the entire module to hang after running for
   approximately 30 seconds. We haven't figured out exactly why, but we
   suspect it has to do with too much throughput, and the child process
   not being able to read the data from stdout fast enough. Additionally,
   attempting to cover the sensors or swiping across the sensors rapidly
   can cause the module to lock up. We are actively looking into
   this issue, but, if you can exercise patience, and swipe through your
   pages at a moderate pace, you will not experience this issue.

   If you notice any bugs, please let us know, and we'll do our best to
   correct them.

   Side note, I'm sure you noticed we abused the use of the special
   =tags=... =Well, we like how it looks=.

* Future Work
  We intend to add more options that can be tweaked from the
  =config.js=, such as:\\
  * being able to change the direction in which pages slide
    (ie. left-to-right or right-to-left)
  * adjusting the number of samples the sensors use for determining
    motion

  If you have any suggestions that would be cool, or useful, feel free
  to email us!

* Performance Demonstration
[[./videos/MMM-Simple-Swiper-Demo.mp4]]

* Step-By-Step Instructions
** Screencasted Video of Installation
   [[./videos/MMM-Simple-Swiper-Installation.mp4]]
** Before getting started...

   1) The demo installation was done on a _Raspberry Pi 3 B_ running
      Raspbian
      * The board was _BRAND NEW_ and the OS was _FRESHLY_ installed
      * The installation occurred after the initial boot and initial
        update
        + =Remote GPIO= and =SSH= were enabled under =raspi-config=
        + (You can enable them as well, if you would like to by
          following below)
          1) Open a terminal window
          2) run =sudo raspi-config=
          3) select =Interfacing Options=, select =SSH=; select =<YES>=
             to enable
          4) Also within =Interfacing Options=; select =Remote GPIO=;
             select =<YES>= to enable

        + I created SSH keys & copied them to my laptop (for easier
          SSHing)
          * For information on how to do this, see:
            https://www.ssh.com/ssh/keygen/
        + Otherwise, nothing else beyond what is shown was installed or
          removed

   2) I used my laptop to SSH into the Pi and record the installation
      * The Pi cannot handle screen recording + installation of
        MagicMirror very well

   3) All of these steps can be replicated directly from the Raspberry
      Pi 3 B in a terminal

   4) There were no steps skipped throughout the video

   5) Instructions for the =Required Packages= are from the relevant
      Github pages

   6) The Required Packages are the _BARE MINIMUM_ to get this working

   7) _NOTE_: Within the =Basic config.js containing required modules=
      * There are default modules, which can be removed, if desired
        (see comments within file)
